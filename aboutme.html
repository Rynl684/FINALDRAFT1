      <h2> When was McDonalds Created?</h2>
      <p> McDonalds was created on April 15, 1955 in San Bernardino, California. It was founded by two brothers, Maurice McDonald and Richard McDonald.
      This is why McDonald is named McDonald. After a couple days after McDonalds was created, they made the Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, and the Egg McMuffin. 
      McDonalds was the first company to make a drive thru for their food and this passed on to many other fast food restaurants such as Burger King and In and Out.
